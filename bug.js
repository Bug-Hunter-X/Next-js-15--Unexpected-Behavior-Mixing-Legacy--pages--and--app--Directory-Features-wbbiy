In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `app` directory's features alongside legacy features like `getStaticProps` or `getStaticPaths` within pages located in the `pages` directory.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors if these features aren't carefully managed and isolated from the newer app directory's routing and data fetching mechanisms. For instance, attempting to use `getStaticProps` in a `pages` route that is overshadowed by a similar route in the `app` directory may result in unpredictable results.  The issue stems from Next.js attempting to reconcile both approaches.
